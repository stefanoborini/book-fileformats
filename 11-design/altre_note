berkeley db usa pagine da 512 a 64k byte di dimensione. la dimensione della pagina viene impostata alla creazione del database.

overflow pages: se i dati non entrano in una pagina, una pagina di overflo e' allocata corollariamente.

page level locking. per multithreading. piu' dati sono memorizzati in una
stessa pagina. il lock non e' sul record, ma potenzialmente su piu' record in
una stessa pagina.

checkpointing:  Running normal recovery can become expensive if over time all
that is ever written to disk is BTree leaf nodes. So in order to limit the time
required for normal recovery, JE runs checkpoints. Checkpoints write to your
log files all the internal BTree nodes and structures modified as a part of
write operations. This means that your log files contain a complete BTree up to
the moment in time when the checkpoint was run. The result is that normal
recovery only needs to recreate the portion of the BTree that has been modified
since the time of the last checkpoint.

Checkpoints typically write more information to disk than do transaction
commits, and so they are more expensive from a disk I/O perspective. You will
therefore need to consider how frequently to run checkpoints as a part of your
performance tuning activities. When you do this, balance the cost of the
checkpoints against the time it will take your application to restart due to
the cost of running normal recovery.

Checkpoints normally performed by the checkpointer background thread, always running. 
Run when log file surpasses a given size.
